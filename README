This script is easy to use. Just plug in the camera, and launch the script.
Most is handled for you:
for each photo that is on the camera, it will be retrieved. You will be asked under what name to save it, and in which directory.

And at the end, you can choose to remove all photos from the camera or not.

Requirements: evince, gphoto2 (should be easily modifiable to be used with equivalent tools).
